    "A while ago when I was learning classical mechanics I started wondering what makes a good physical Lagrangian and how does its shape impact the laws of motion. I seem to be more of software engineer than a physycist in spirit so rather than learning classical mechanics, instead I ended up doing various experiments with plotting, rendering, modelling and literate programming. So while I'm not exactly doing any novel physics here, I also haven't seen this visualised anywhere (apart from the simplest case). Hopefully it will help other people in understanding and serve as a demo of Ipython's capabilities.\n",

    "This post assumes some basic (wikipedia level) understanding of Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics, but you don't have to if you just fancy some plots. For the purposes of this post, Lagrangian is just any function of a particle's position and velocity."
